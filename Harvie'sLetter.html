    <h1> LETTER </h1>
    <pre> My Love,

From the moment you came into my life, everything has felt lighter, brighter, and more meaningful. Being with you is like finding the missing piece of my heart that I didn’t even know I was searching for. Every day with you feels like a blessing, and I can’t help but fall deeper in love with you.

I love the way you make me laugh, the way you listen when I share even the smallest stories, and the way you always make me feel safe and cherished. You have a way of turning ordinary moments into something magical, simply because you’re there.

Whenever I think of the future, I see you right by my side—through every high and low, every dream and every challenge. I want to keep holding your hand, building memories, and loving you in every way I can.

Thank you for being my best friend, my safe place, and the love of my life. I promise to keep loving you more each day, with all my heart.</pre>
